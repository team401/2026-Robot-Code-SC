/**
 * The DependencyOrderedExecutor handles the order of all actions that take place in periodic based
 * on the dependencies that they have declared. It runs each action in an order such that all of its
 * dependencies have been executed beforehand.
 *
 * <p>Subsystems must register methods to update inputs or apply outputs by calling
 * `registerAction`. Then, they can call `addDependencies` by passing that action and its
 * dependencies. Actions are represented by an ActionKey object that stores their unique ID. This
 * means that each subsystem can keep track of its own actions and provide a handle to those actions
 * by the use of static methods to other classes. After all actions and dependencies have been
 * registered, call `finalizeSchedule`, which will generate the dependency graph and execution
 * order. After this, calling `execute` will execute all actions in order.
