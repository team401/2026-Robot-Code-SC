/**
 * A State implementation that wraps and drives a {@code Command} for the duration of the state.
 *
 * <p>This state forwards lifecycle events from the state machine to an optional {@code Command}
 * instance:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>onEntry(...) &nbsp;&nbsp;→ calls {@code command.initialize()} if a command is set
 *   <li>periodic(...) &nbsp;→ calls {@code command.execute()} each periodic update while active
 *   <li>onExit(...) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;→ calls {@code command.end(false)} if a command
 *       is set
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The presence of a {@code Command} is optional; if no command is supplied (i.e. {@code null}),
 * the state performs no command-related actions. The {@code Command} is not scheduled with any
 * external scheduler by this class — only its lifecycle methods are invoked directly by the state
 * machine callbacks.
 *
 * @param <World> the type of the world/context object passed to state lifecycle methods
 * @see #getCommand()
 * @see #setCommand(Command)
